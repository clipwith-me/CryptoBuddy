You are a coding assistant. Help me build a **Python-based crypto chatbot** named CryptoBuddy. Follow these steps and create a working chatbot:

1. **Bot Personality**
   - Name: CryptoBuddy
   - Tone: Friendly, approachable, slightly playful.
   - Sample greeting: "Hey there! Letâ€™s find you a green and growing crypto!"

2. **Predefined Crypto Data**
   - Use this dataset:
   
```python
crypto_db = {
    "Bitcoin": {
        "price_trend": "rising",
        "market_cap": "high",
        "energy_use": "high",
        "sustainability_score": 3/10
    },
    "Ethereum": {
        "price_trend": "stable",
        "market_cap": "high",
        "energy_use": "medium",
        "sustainability_score": 6/10
    },
    "Cardano": {
        "price_trend": "rising",
        "market_cap": "medium",
        "energy_use": "low",
        "sustainability_score": 8/10
    }
}
Chatbot Logic

Accept user input as text.

Respond to questions like:

"Which crypto is trending up?"

"Whatâ€™s the most sustainable coin?"

Use if-else statements or functions to select crypto based on user queries.

Include advice rules:

Profitability: prioritize price_trend = "rising" and market_cap = "high".

Sustainability: prioritize energy_use = "low" and sustainability_score > 7/10.

Sample Conversation

python
Copy code
User: Which crypto should I buy for long-term growth?
CryptoBuddy: Cardano (ADA) is trending up and has a top-tier sustainability score! ðŸš€
Optional Stretch Goals

Integrate CoinGecko API for real-time data.

Use NLTK to handle natural language queries.

Add a disclaimer: "Crypto is riskyâ€”always do your own research!"

Submission Requirements

Create a GitHub repo with .py file(s) and an Intro README.

Include screenshots of the chatbot running.

Record a 30-second demo of interacting with the chatbot.

Write a 50-word summary explaining: "How does this chatbot mimic basic AI decision-making?"

Instructions

Keep the code simple, readable, and commented.

Ensure chatbot can run in Replit.

Focus on logic + creativity, not complex math.
